this is my file for practicsing commits over and over again until i am perfect at them

now im pretending that im adding code so that i can practice another commit. What is the process? 

1. edit file
2. save file and close
3.git add "file"
4. git commit "File" -m "Message"
5. git push

I'm adding this part in from my browser on github, to see if i can then pull the change onto my desktop file.

just another commit to practice with
